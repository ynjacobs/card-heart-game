# Heart of the Cards

## Intro

You came at the perfect time! We were all set to ship our new poker application – Super Top-Notch Poker –  when it hit us... we never wrote the code for managing the deck! As you can imagine, this is a critical part of the application. I mean, how can you play poker without a deck?

It's not all bad news though, we *did* write a suite of tests that describe *how* the deck should work. That's where you come in: we need you to read through the test cases and write the code that will allow them to pass. I don't want to cause you undue stress, but there's a lot riding on this game, and this is the final piece. Think you're up for the challenge?

## Prerequisite Knowledge

You should be comfortable with:

- JavaScript fundamentals, including:
  - data types;
  - iteration;
  - functions and methods;
  - classes;
  - basic debugging;
- Node
- The command line

## Goal of this Assignment

By the end of this exercise, you should have a good understanding of the following:
- How to run a JavaScript test suite.
- How to read and extract information from test cases written in JavaScript.
- How to write code that satisifies existing tests.

## Getting Started

- Download this repository, including all `README` and exercise files.
- Install the dependencies by running `npm install` from the command line.
- Run the test suite using the following command: `npm run test`
  - Since we haven't implemented any code yet, all of the tests *should* fail.

After you've completed the steps above, open the following files in your IDE of choice:
- `test/deck.test.js`
- `src/deck.js`

Read over the test cases in `test/deck.test.js`. Once you understand the requirements of the exercise, update the `src/deck.js` file with the code that will allow each test to pass. Make sure to test your solutions and commit often!

## Instructions

- Additional notes have been included in both the `test/deck.test.js` and `src/deck.js` files.

## Submitting

Remember to submit your code when you're finished.
